  abstract = {For many applications where accuracy, availability, and integrity are essential, such as geodetic positioning and civil aviation, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are indispensable. However, GNSS signal dependability is severely hampered by ionospheric disturbances, especially equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), particularly in equatorial latitudes. To better understand how ionospheric irregularities impact GNSS signals across several constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, and Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems) and frequencies, this study examines ionospheric amplitude scintillation. The objective is to comprehend how these anomalies simultaneously affect GNSS performance in high scintillation activity conditions. The research focuses on the effects of amplitude scintillation during periods of high solar activity by analyzing data from four stations across Brazil. The analysis identified the most critical hours for scintillation events, between 20:00 and 23:59 LST, where up to 13 satellites were simultaneously affected at PRU2, resulting in a notable drop in positioning accuracy. This was further reflected in the degradation of Position Dilution of Precision values, which exceeded 5 in approximately 38\% of the cases at Presidente Prudente and S{\~a}o Jos{\'e} dos Campos, indicating reduced confidence in positioning accuracy during severe scintillation events. Additionally, the study confirms that lower-frequency signals (L2, G2, B2) are more susceptible to scintillation than higher-frequency signals (L1, G1, E1). Despite multi-constellation capabilities, the simultaneous impact of EPBs on multiple GNSS signals leads to degraded satellite availability and positioning accuracy, especially in regions with high electron density. These findings highlight the need for improved mitigation strategies in multi-constellation systems to enhance GNSS reliability in equatorial regions.},

A new processing chain with updated editing and data correction (i.e., using FES2014 as Ocean tide model) has been implemented.

  author = {Briggs, B H and Parkin, I A},
  abstract = {The theory of the variation of the depth of amplitude scintillations with the zenith anglo of the source is considered, for radio waves received from a star or a satellite. It is assumed that irregular phase fluctuations are impressed on the wave in travelling through the ionosphere, and that the amplitude fluctuations develop by a diffraction process as the wave propagates in the free space beneath the ionosphere. Two effects are produced by an increase in the zenith angle of the source. The magnitude of the phase perturbations increases, because the thickness of the ionosphere along the line of sight increases, and the geometry of the diffraction process changes. Theoretical results are given, both for isotropic irregularities and for irregularities elongated along the direction of the earth's magnetic field. The advantages of observing simultaneously on two wavelengths are stressed. Some comparisons with available experimental data are made, and suggestions are made for future experiments. Irregularities at different distances from the observer are not equally effective in producing amplitude scintillations, and some examples of the "weighting function" which determines their effectiveness are given. Various measures of "scintillation depth" are discussed and related to each other.},

  abstract = {Global navigation satellite systems-reflectometry (GNSS-R) is an emerging technique that uses navigation opportunistic signals as a multistatic radar. Most GNSS systems operate at L-band, which is affected by the ionosphere. At present, there is only a GNSS-R space-borne scatterometer on board the UK TechDemoSat-1, but in late 2016, NASA will launch the CYGNSS constellation, and in 2019, ESA will carry out the GEROS experiment on board the International Space Station. In GNSS-R, reflected signals are typically processed in open loop using a short coherent integration time ( 1 ms), followed by long incoherent averaging ( 1000 times, 1 s) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, the global ionospheric scintillation model is first used to evaluate the total electron content and the scintillation index S4. The ionospheric scintillation impact is then evaluated as a degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio, which can be used to assess the altimetry and scatterometry performance degradation in a generic GNSS-R mission. Since ionospheric scintillations are mostly produced by a layer of electron density irregularities at 350 km height, underneath most LEO satellites, but closer to them than to the Earth's surface, intensity scintillations occur especially in the GNSS transmitter-to-ground transect, therefore, the impact is very similar in conventional and interferometric GNSS-R. Using UK TechDemoSat-1 data, signal-to-noise ratio fluctuations are computed and geo-located, finding that they occur in the open ocean along {\textpm}20{$^\circ$} from the geomagnetic equator where S4 exhibits a maximum, and in low wind speed regions, where reflected signals contain a non-negligible coherent component.},

In this paper, we characterize the turbulent ionospheric medium that produced these scintillations. Using 10\,Hz GPS carrier-to-noise measurements at Boa Vista (2.9{$^\circ$}N, 60.7{$^\circ$}W), Alta Floresta (9.9{$^\circ$}S, 56.1{$^\circ$}W), and Campo Grande (20.5{$^\circ$}S, 54.7{$^\circ$}W), we report on the variation of turbulent intensity, phase spectral index, and irregularity zonal drift as a function of latitude and local time for the evening of 1-2 November 2002. The method of analysis is new and, unlike analytical theories of scintillation based on the Born or Rytov approximations, it is valid when the scintillation index saturates due to multiple-scatter effects. Our principal findings are that (1) the strength of turbulence tended to be largest near the crests of the equatorial anomaly and at early postsunset local times, (2) the turbulent intensity was generally stronger and lasted two hours longer at Campo Grande than at Boa Vista, (3) the phase spectral index was similar at the three stations but increased from 2.5 to 4.5 with local time, and (4) our estimates of zonal irregularity drift are consistent with those provided by the spaced-receiver technique.},

A specific normalization was invoked to achieve a universal scaling, such that different combinations of perturbation strength, propagation distance, and frequency produce the same results. The theory is equally valid in the weak, intermediate, and strong scatter regimes. In this paper we consider the inverse problem, whereby phase screen parameters are inferred from measured scintillation time series as a means of interpreting the irregularities physically. The screen parameters are obtained by fitting the spectral density function (SDF) of intensity fluctuations with a parametrized theoretical model using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) technique. We refer to this fitting procedure as Irregularity Parameter Estimation (IPE) since it provides a statistical description of the refractive index irregularities from the scintillations they produce. In this paper, we introduce an additional rescaling that enables IPE to be applied without a-priori knowledge of the location of the irregularities or their motion.},

  abstract = {We develop a phase screen model called the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Scintillation Simulator (SAR-SS) for predicting the impacts of ionospheric scintillation on SAR image formation. SAR-SS consists of a phase screen generator and a propagator. The screen generator creates a 2-D random realization of spatial phase fluctuations resulting from the traversal of small-scale field-aligned irregularities in the ionosphere. It accounts for the motion of the radar platform, the drift of the ionospheric irregularities, and the oblique angle of propagation, all of which determine the scale sizes of the irregularities sampled by the radar beam. The propagator solves the 3-D parabolic wave equation using the split step technique to compute the ionospheric transfer function for two-way propagation. This ionospheric transfer function is used to modulate the SAR signal due to terrestrial features in order to assess the ionospheric impact on SAR image formation in the small target approximation. We compare simulated and observed PALSAR imagery over Brazil during disturbed ionospheric conditions. We demonstrate that SAR-SS can reproduce the field-aligned streaks in PALSAR imagery caused by irregularities in the equatorial ionosphere that have been observed by previous authors. The field-aligned streaks exhibited a dominant wavelength larger than the Fresnel break scale, which suggests that refractive scatter was dominant over diffraction as the physical mechanism responsible for the scintillation of the radar signal in this case. The spectral index of phase fluctuations in the screen was quite large (9.0), suggesting that these irregularities were possibly associated with bottomside sinudoidal irregularities rather than equatorial plasma bubbles.           ,              Key Points                                                                Ionospheric scintillation degrades SAR imagery                                                     We present a phase screen technique to predict this effect                                                     We compare simulated and observed images from PALSAR},

The two-component model includes, as special cases, an unmodified power law and a modified power law with spectral break that may assume the role of an outer scale, intermediate break scale, or inner scale. As such, it provides a framework for investigating the effects of a spectral break on the scintillation statistics. Using this spectral model, we solve the fourth moment equation governing intensity variations following propagation through two-dimensional field-aligned irregularities in the ionosphere. A specific normalization is invoked that exploits self-similar properties of the structure to achieve a universal scaling, such that different combinations of perturbation strength, propagation distance, and frequency produce the same results. The numerical algorithm is validated using new theoretical predictions for the behavior of the scintillation index and intensity correlation length under strong scatter conditions. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the morphologies of the intensity spectrum, scintillation index, and intensity correlation length as functions of the spectral indices and strength of scatter; retrieve phase screen parameters from intensity scintillation observations; explore the relative contributions to the scintillation due to large- and small-scale ionospheric structures; and quantify the conditions under which a general spectral break will influence the scintillation statistics.},

We focus on the high-latitude scintillation problem, taking advantage of a conjunction of European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT) observations and a GPS scintillation monitor viewing the same line of sight. Just after 20:00 UT on 17 October 2013, an auroral E region ionization enhancement occurred with associated phase scintillations. This investigation uses the scintillation observations to estimate the ionospheric electron density distribution beyond the spatial resolution of EISCAT (5--15 km along the line of sight in this case). Following the approach of Deshpande et al. (2014), signal propagation is modeled through a specified density distribution. A multiple phase screen propagation algorithm is applied to irregularities conforming to the description of Costa and Kelley (1977) and constrained to match the macroscopic conditions observed by EISCAT. A 50-member ensemble of modeled outputs is approximately consistent with the observations according to the standard deviation of the phase ({$\sigma$}p). The observations have {$\sigma$}p = 0.23 rad, while the ensemble of modeled realizations has {$\sigma$}p = 0.23 + 0.04--0.04. By comparison of the model output with the scintillation observations, we show that the density fluctuations cannot be a constant fraction of the mean density. The model indicates that E region density fluctuations whose standard deviation varies temporally between 5 and 25\% of the mean (EISCAT-observed) density are required to explain the observed phase scintillations.},

  abstract = {The eruption of large volcanoes may potentially disturb the upper atmosphere, causing disturbances in ionospheric plasma and triggering irregular changes in the Total Electron Content (TEC). The GNSS ionospheric inversion method has been used to analyze ionospheric anomalies caused by the volcano, while it was limited to the spatial distribution of ground-based GNSS. The joint observation with space-based GNSS can further improve the spatio-temporal distribution of ionospheric monitoring. The Tonga volcano erupted on January 15th, 2022, is the largest volcanic eruption since the beginning of the 21st century and generated intense acoustic, atmospheric gravity waves and ionospheric disturbance. In this paper, we used the GIM products, ground-based GNSS station data around the volcanic eruption point and COSMIC occultation data to analyze the short-term TEC change. The experiments showed that: the average TEC of GIM grid data on eruption day dropped by 7.5 TECu compared to the last day which was substantially larger than other three days. The TEC extracted from nearby tracking stations was smaller than GIM and the difference was inversely proportional to the distance between the station and the volcanic eruption site. The average daily ionospheric TEC obtained from the nearest TONG station was the biggest, as much as 3.44 TECu lower. The peak electron density of COSMIC occultation data gradually diminished and then recovered with TEC about 7.32 TECu lower than GIM products. The experments showed that there was a good consistency in the TEC obtained from space-based and ground-based GNSS, the Tonga volcano produced a huge TEC change over 10 TECu or even bigger. As a global grid product, GIM underestimated ionospheric changes due to its limited spatial resolution, which needs further improvement.},

  abstract = {Kalman filter has been applied extensively to the target tracking. The estimation performance of Kalman filter is closely resulted by the quality of prior information about the process noise covariance (Q) and the measurement noise covariance (R). Therefore, the development of adaptive Kalman filter is mainly to reduce the estimation errors produced by the uncertainty of Q and R. In this paper, the proposed self-adaptive Kalman filter algorithm has solved the problems of covariance-matching method about the determination of the width of the window and the addition of storage burden and that can update Q and R simultaneously. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method outperforms the traditional Kalman filter and has the better estimation performance than the other two adaptive Kalman filters in the target tracking. The developed filtering algorithm has the following characteristics: high robustness, low computing load, easy operation and tuning Q, R simultaneously.},

  abstract = {General solutions to the optimal stochastic control problem, or the combined estimation and control problem, are extremely difficult to compute since dynamic programming is required. However, if the system is linear, if the measurements are linear, and if the cost is quadratic, then the optimal stochastic controller is separated into 1) a filter to generate the conditional mean of the state, and 2) the optimum (linear) controller that results when all uncertainties are neglected. By altering the system configuration a new separation theorem is derived for arbitrary nonlinear measurements, discrete-time linear systems, and a quadratic cost. If a feedback loop is placed around the nonlinear measurement device (e.g., an analog-to-digital converter), then the stochastic control can be found without dynamic programming and is computed by cascading a nonlinear filter and the optimum (linear) controller. The primary advantage is the significant saving in computation. The performance of this new system configuration relative to the system without feedback depends on the nonlinearity, and it is not necessarily superior. A numerical example is presented.},

Based on the GISM model, it is determined that the ionospheric scintillation index (S4) for the telemetry link in the S band (2 208 MHz) between Cuiab{\'a} station and the SCD2 satellite, depending on the date and time, can reach values greater than 0.8. This is the first study conducted on ionospheric S-band scintillation in this region of the earth. In this article, the channel model for the link and the telemetry receiver architecture are presented, in order to evaluate subsequently some of ionospheric scintillation effects on the functioning of the communication system. The modulation used is OQPSK and a fully-digital demodulator recovers the carrier phase using a Costas loop and synchronizes the symbols using a Gardner synchronizer. The design of OQPSK demodulator is detailed and the impact of ionospheric scintillation on general demodulator performance and on the functioning of its modules is discussed. The system bit error rate, the error variances of the carrier phase and symbol delay in different conditions of severity of ionospheric scintillation were figured out through computer simulation. From the presented results, it is evident that, for the adopted receiver architecture, which was designed for a space channel without scintillation, there is a substancial degradation on performance of the system even for S4 = 0.5 and, for the scenario where S4 = 0.8, the link becomes practically inoperative.},

  abstract = {In a GNSS receiver the measure of C/N0 is not only supplementary information provided to the user together with the PVT (position, velocity, time), but it is also fundamental information to determine the status of the tracking subsystems and to control the receiver in critical environments. A classic approach to estimate the C/N0 in a navigation receiver is known as the narrowband-wideband power ratio method (NWPR). We investigate the suitability of different estimation methods, properly adapted from the digital communications world where a wide range of literature is available on the problem of estimating the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) of M-PSK modulations in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The objective here is to identify a subset of candidate algorithms for SNR estimation, previously proposed for communications receivers. These methods are compared in specific situations of interest, such as weak signals or high signal-to-noise conditions obtained with high-gain antennas, and considering software defined radio receiver implementations. Simulation campaigns and a set of real GPS-L1 signals are used to test and compare the performance of the selected algorithms in a broad range of C/N0 values (from 20 to 70 dBHz), where the classic NWPR method is used as an authoritative benchmark. We conclude that a number of low-complexity algorithms for SNR estimation, based on a simple communication signal model, can be tailored to digital GNSS receivers. The performance is comparable with respect to the NWPR approach, but the complexity is reduced and possible improvements can be foreseen using the tested algorithms.},

A generic discrete multi-frequency state-space model (SSM) of the line-ofsight (LOS) dynamics is derived as a Wiener process and the feasibility of using VAR models to represent the ionospheric scintillation effects is analyzed. Our findings reveal that multi-frequency VAR models significantly outperform single-frequency autoregressive (AR) models in decoupling LOS dynamics from ionospheric scintillation effects, with multi-frequency algorithms demonstrating superior performance in most conditions.

  abstract = {This paper treats the problem of tracking the global navigation satellite system's (GNSS) signal phase under ionospheric scintillations and to generate an estimate of the scintillation phase and amplitude. In the case of ionospheric scintillations traditional phase locked loop (PLL) based GNSS receivers have problems to track the signal phase accurately. Moreover, these receivers do not estimate the scintillation phase and amplitude, which is evaluated in ionospheric monitoring applications. Therefore, Kalman filter based phase tracking algorithms have been proposed, which track line-of-sight (LOS) phase and scintillation amplitude and phase separately with different state space models. For modeling the scintillation phase and amplitude auto-regressive (AR) models can be used. In this case the parameters for the AR model have to be estimated together with the LOS and scintillation phase and amplitude. We propose to use a second Kalman filter for the estimation of the AR model parameters. This Kalman filter takes the scintillation phase and amplitude estimates from the first Kalman filter as measurement and the AR model parameters as system state. Simulation results for the global positioning system (GPS) show that the proposed algorithm achieves the same estimation performance for scintillation phase and amplitude as an algorithm with a priori knowledge on the AR model parameters.},

The development of this model was initiated in the late 1960s using the FORTRAN language; for its programming approach, the model outputs were calculated separately for each given geographic location and time stamp. The Consultative Committee on International Radio (CCIR) and International Union of Radio Science (URSI) coefficients provide the skeleton of the IRI model, as they define the global distribution of the maximum useable ionospheric frequency foF2 and the propagation factor M(3,000)F2. At the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, a novel Python tool was developed that enables global runs of the IRI model with significantly lower computational overhead. This was made possible through the Python rebuild of the core IRI component (which calculates ionospheric critical frequency using the CCIR or URSI coefficients), taking advantage of NumPy matrix multiplication instead of using cyclic addition. This paper explains in detail this new approach and introduces all components of the PyIRI package.},

We present here early results of the observations; salient points include the following. First, most of the data are consistent with phase-screen modeling of the production of ionospheric scintillation, including an {\textflorin}-2 frequency dependence for phase variance. Second, propagation theories invoking weak, single scatter seldom are adequate, because even moderate intensity scintillation usually is accompanied by phase fluctuations comparable to or greater than a radian. Third, under conditions producing GHz scintillation (near the geomagnetic equator), lower frequencies show marked diffraction effects, including breakdown of the simple {\textflorin}-2 behavior of phase variance and loss of signal coherenceacross a band as narrow as 11.5 MHz at UHF.},

  abstract = {We contribute to the debate on the identification of phase scintillation induced by the ionosphere on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) by introducing a phase detrending method able to provide realistic values of the phase scintillation index at high latitude. It is based on the fast iterative filtering signal decomposition technique, which is a recently developed fast implementation of the well-established adaptive local iterative filtering algorithm. FIF has been conceived to decompose nonstationary signals efficiently and provide a discrete set of oscillating functions, each of them having its frequency. It overcomes most of the problems that arise when using traditional time--frequency analysis techniques and relies on a consolidated mathematical basis since its a priori convergence and stability have been proved. By relying on the capability of FIF to efficiently identify the frequencies embedded in the GNSS raw phase, we define a method based on the FIF-derived spectral features to identify the proper cutoff frequency for phase detrending. To test such a method, we analyze the data acquired from GPS and Galileo signals over Antarctica during the September 2017 storm by the ionospheric scintillation monitor receiver (ISMR) located in Concordia Station (75.10{$^\circ$} S, 123.33{$^\circ$} E). Different cases of diffraction and refraction effects are provided, showing the capability of the method in deriving a more accurate determination of the {$\sigma\phi$} index. We found values of cutoff frequency in the range of 0.73--0.83 Hz, providing further evidence of the inadequacy of the choice of 0.1 Hz, which is often used when dealing with ionospheric scintillation monitoring at high latitudes.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric scintillation is an interference characterized by rapid and random fluctuations in radio frequency signals when passing through irregularities in the ionosphere. It can severely degrade the performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, thus increasing positioning errors. Receivers with different tracking loop bandwidths and coherent integration times perform differently under scintillation. This study investigates the effects of GNSS receiver tracking loop tuning on scintillation monitoring and Phase Locked Loop (PLL) tracking jitter estimation using simulated GNSS data. The variation of carrier to noise density ratio (C/N0) under scintillation with different tracking loop settings is also studied. The results show that receiver tuning has a minor effect on scintillation indices calculation. The levels of C/N0 are also similar for different PLL bandwidths and integration times. Additionally, the tracking jitter is estimated by theoretical equations and verified using the relationship with the PLL discriminator output noise, which is calculated using the post-correlation measurements. Novel approaches are further proposed to calculate 1-s scintillation index, which enables to compute the tracking jitter at a rate of 1 s. It is found that 1-s tracking jitter can successfully represent the signal fluctuations levels caused by scintillation. This work is valuable for developing scintillation sensitive tracking error models and is also of great significance for GNSS receiver design to mitigate scintillation effects.},

  abstract = {Use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers for real-time applications has improved significantly all over the world. The main problem with the designed receivers is their failure to function under harsh environmental conditions because of the structured phase-locked loop (PLL) architecture. One of the most critical phenomena that cause signal degradation in GNSS receiver is ionospheric scintillations, which create disturbances in amplitude and phase of the received signal. The problem in signal acquisition and tracking, even in the severe canonical fades (deep amplitude fading correlated with reference to half cycle phase jumps), can be mitigated using robust and adaptive carrier tracking algorithms. The autoregressive exogenous modeling parameters are useful in estimating the amplitude and phase scintillations. The proposed adaptive-extended Kalman filter (AEKF) approach works as an effective carrier tracking algorithm maintaining a balance in dual problems faced by PLL-based receivers, i.e., (estimation versus mitigation) and (dynamics versus noise reduction) tradeoff. The developed AEKF algorithm performed well for synthetic Cornell scintillation monitor data and for Global Positioning System L1 PRN 12 data collected around 21.30 H (local time) on October 24, 2012, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with GNSS Software Navigation Receiver.},

  abstract = {The 7~years electron density data observed by the Swarm constellation and 527 earthquakes with M~{$\geq~$}6.0 are used to investigate the relationship between ionospheric disturbances and seismic events. The disturbances of the ionospheric electron density, defined as the difference between the orbital observation data and its fitting data, are considered to be possible signals of the seismic activity and are often reported before or after earthquakes near the epicenter. To investigate the relationship between them, the spatial distribution characteristics of the disturbances are analysed, taking into account the influence of solar and geomagnetic activity on the disturbances; the variation characteristics of the disturbances in seismic and non-seismic regions are compared; the numbers of the disturbances before and after earthquakes are statistically analysed; and the statistical results of different earthquake groups are verified by comparison with random events. Finally, according to these analysis results, it can be concluded that most of the disturbances are related to ionospheric activities; some of disturbances are indeed related to seismic activity; the disturbances caused by seismic activities usually appear before the earthquakes. In terms of standardized probability, the results for M {$\geq$} 6 earthquakes and sea earthquakes are most significant, exceeding two times the standard deviation at least 10 and 25 days before the earthquake, while the results for deep earthquakes (D {$\geq$} 60 km) and land earthquakes are not significant. However, the disturbances caused by seismic activities are very weak and are hidden in those strong ionospheric activities. Therefore, the seismic ionospheric phenomena are so difficult to extract and identify, and more caution should be taken in the identification in future seismo-ionospheric phenomena research.},

The data-driven testbed provides researchers a tool for studying, and the receiver developers a tool for testing, the behavior of carrier tracking loops under realistic scintillation conditions. It is known that severe equatorial scintillation causes cycle slipping and, in the worst cases, complete loss of carrier lock. Testbed results indicate that cycle slips are primarily caused by the abrupt, near half-cycle phase changes that occur during the deep power fades of severe equatorial scintillation. For a class of standard tracking loops, parameter values that minimize scintillation-induced cycle slipping are identified.},

The aim of this study is to determine the loop structures and parameters that enable good phase tracking during the power fades and phase dynamics induced by scintillations. Constant-bandwidth and variable-bandwidth loops are studied using theoretical models, simulation, and tests with actual GPS signals. Constant-bandwidth loops with loop bandwidths near 15 Hz are shown to lose phase lock during scintillations. Use of the decision-directed discriminator reduces the carrier lock threshold by {\textexclamdown}<<1 dB relative to the arctangent and conventional Costas discriminators. A proposed variable bandwidth loop based on a Kalman filter reduces the carrier lock threshold by more than 7 dB compared to a 15-Hz constant-bandwidth loop. The Kalman filter-based strategy employs a soft-decision discriminator, explicitly models the e.ects of receiver clock noise, and optimally adapts the loop bandwidth to the carrier-to-noise ratio. In extensive simulation and in tests using actual wideband GPS data, the Kalman filter PLL demonstrates improved cycle slip immunity relative to constant bandwidth PLLs.},

In the model, scintillation amplitude is assumed to follow a Rice distribution, and the spectrum of the rapidly-varying component of complex scintillation is assumed to follow that of a low-pass second-order Butterworth filter. These assumptions are justified, and the model validated, by comparison with phase-screen-generated and empirical scintillation data in realistic tracking loop tests. The model can be mechanized as a scintillation simulator that expects only two input parameters: the scintillation index and the decorrelation time . Hardware-in-the-loop tests show how the model can be used to test the scintillation robustness of any compatible GPS receiver.},

This paper presents the ionospheric observations during a geomagnetic storm, and the observed consequences for the positioning service. Significant disruptions that can be clearly related to the ionospheric disturbances were observed. They tend to occur in roughly longitudinal bands, which is expected for disturbances caused by the particle and energy precipitation in the auroral oval. The position error is found to increase exponentially with increasing rate of TEC index (ROTI). The disturbances are compared to auroral electrojet measurements and results from an operational auroral oval forecasting model. The disturbances are found to be strongly related to auroral electrojet currents.},

The Norwegian Mapping Authority is operating a national real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning network and has in recent years developed software and services and deployed instrumentation to monitor space weather disturbances. Here, we report on our observations during this event. Strong GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) disturbances, measured by the rate-of-TEC index (ROTI), were observed at all latitudes in Norway on March 17th and early on March 18th. Late on the 18th, strong disturbances were only observed in northern parts of Norway. We study the ionospheric disturbances in relation to the auroral electrojet currents, showing that the most intense disturbances of GNSS signals occur on the poleward side of poleward-moving current regions. This indicates a possible connection to ionospheric polar cap plasma patches and/or particle precipitation caused by magnetic reconnection in the magnetosphere tail. We also study the impact of the disturbances on the network RTK and Precise Point Positioning (PPP) techniques. The vertical position errors increase rapidly with increasing ROTI for both techniques, but PPP is more precise than RTK at all disturbance levels.},

Specifically, the proposed method decomposes the noise covariance matrix into an element distribution matrix and a noise intensity and employs an improved Sage filter to estimate the element distribution matrix. Additionally, a calibration and correction method is introduced to accurately determine and adaptively correct the online bias of the noise intensity. The unbiasedness and convergence of the proposed method are mathematically proven under the condition that the system is detectable. Moreover, this method is applied to multiobject tracking (MOT) based on KFs and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and it is evaluated on the KITTI dataset and the official KITTI server. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly improved MOT performance based on KFs and outperforms other LiDAR-based methods on the KITTI leaderboard. This method provides a new approach for enhancing the performance of KFs and assisting with MOT, and it has practical feasibility for real-world applications.},

The literature does neither address how the factors, including the line-of-sight (LOS) jerk, the local oscillator error, and the measurement noise, impact on the performance of the KF. Furthermore, there is no the rule-ofthumb threshold for the KF up to now. We prove that the steady KF is equivalent to a 3rd-order PLL in the sense of the minimum covariance in the continuous KF form, which makes it possible to compare the KF and the PLL loops in terms of the equivalent bandwidth. The factors that impact the performance of the KF are further investigated by error budgeting and suboptimal analysis. The analysis results show that the oscillator error, the LOS jerk, and the measurement error affect the steady KF error significantly while the initial state covariance has little effect on the convergence of the KF. A rule-of-thumb threshold for the KF, which is determined by the root mean squares of the loop thermal noise and the dynamic stress noise, is presented by analyzing the counterpart for the PLL. Four KF tracking loops are designed upon the proposed rule-ofthumb analysis, which are further validated by the Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {Radio signal scintillation caused by electron density irregularities in the ionosphere affects the accuracy and integrity of Global Navigation Satellite Systems, especially in the equatorial and high-latitude regions during solar maxima. Scintillation in these two regions, nevertheless, is usually influenced by different factors and thus has different characteristics that cause different effects on GNSS signals. This paper compares the characteristics of high-latitude and equatorial scintillation using multifrequency GPS scintillation data collected at Gakona, Alaska, Jicamarca, Peru, and Ascension Island during the 24th solar maximum. Several statistical distributions are established based on the data to characterize the intensity, duration, and occurrence frequency of scintillation. Results show that scintillation in the equatorial region is generally more severe and longer lasting, while high-latitude scintillation is, in general, more moderate and usually dominated by phase fluctuations. Results also reveal the different impacts of solar activity, geomagnetic activity, and seasons on scintillation in different geographic locations.},

However, reduced bandwidth increases tracking errors due to dynamics. Beyond a certain limit it causes a serious degradation in the dynamic tracking performance. Therefore, there is involvement of a tradeoff between two opposing considerations: narrow tracking loop bandwidths are desired for filtering noise due to thermal effects, but wide tracking loop bandwidths are desired to permit tracking of vehicle dynamics. Optimal tracking loop bandwidths, which yield the minimum errors in a certain dynamics environment, are first investigated. The linear Kalman filter is employed as the optimal estimator. The covariance for the arbitrary gain model is solved and applied to the sensitivity analysis for investigating error growth due to incorrect noise level estimate. Theoretical results are verified by numerical simulation, and results from both approaches are in very good agreement.},

  abstract = {GPS L1 C/A signal scintillation data were collected at the equatorial anomaly over a period of three months using five receivers spaced on magnetic east-west and north-south axes to examine the speed, orientation, shape, width, and duration of GPS scintillation fade patterns. The nighttime speeds were primarily eastward in the range of 100--200 m/s with a significant spread to both larger values and negative (westward) values as expected, given the known behavior of ionospheric drifts and GPS signal path movement. The characteristic velocity was found to be small so that the true velocity was equal to the apparent velocity to a very good approximation. The orientation of the scintillation fade patterns was organized by a simple projection model of the magnetic field along the GPS signal path onto the horizontal plane when the signal paths were aligned no closer than 60{$^\circ$} from the magnetic field. The shape of the scintillation fade pattern was greatly elongated in the magnetic north-south direction, and no change could be detected over a distance of 1 km. The east-west widths of the scintillation fade patterns were variable, but after normalizing to the elevation angle, accounting for the fade orientation, and eliminating signal paths within 60{$^\circ$} of the magnetic field, an organized scale length of about 450 m was determined. The duration of the scintillation fade patterns was examined using the optimal cross-correlation amplitude as a measure of change. For a 5 s duration, 49\% of the optimal cross-correlation amplitudes exceed a value of 0.8.},

However, the design of robust carrier tracking techniques under these condition still remains an open problem. The time-varying correlated scintillation phase can be modeled as an AR(p) process, whose linear nature fits very well into the linear Kalman filter formulation and can be embedded into its architecture. State-ofthe-art techniques stand for fixed architectures optimized for very specific scenarios, namely the KF-AR(1). In this paper, a new adaptive KF-AR(p) approach with new implementations with high order AR models (AR-2, AR-3) is proposed so as to match better the input scintillation time series in time-varying scenarios, which also include the presence of AWGN noise. Simulation results are provided to show the enhanced performance and adaptability in these scenarios compared to previous approaches such as the standard Kalman filter and the KF-AR(1).},

  abstract = {Ionospheric scintillation is one of the most challenging sources of errors in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). It is an effect of space weather that introduces rapid amplitude and phase fluctuations to transionospheric signals and, as a result, it severely degrades the tracking performance of receivers, particularly carrier tracking. It can occur anywhere on the earth during intense solar activity, but the problem aggravates in equatorial and high-latitude regions, thus posing serious concerns to the widespread deployment of GNSS in those areas. One of the most promising approaches to address this problem is the use of Kalman filter-based techniques at the carrier tracking level, incorporating some a priori knowledge about the statistics of the scintillation to be dealt with. These techniques aim at dissociating the carrier phase dynamics of interest from phase scintillation by modeling the latter through some correlated Gaussian function, such as the case of autoregressive processes. However, besides the fact that the optimality of these techniques is still to be reached, their applicability for dealing with scintillation in real-world environments also remains to be confirmed. We carry out an extensive analysis and experimentation campaign on the suitability of these techniques by processing real data captures of scintillation at low and high latitudes. We first evaluate how well phase scintillation can be modeled through an autoregressive process. Then, we propose a novel adaptive, low-complexity autoregressive Kalman filter intended to facilitate the implementation of the approach in practice. Last, we provide an analysis of the operational region of the proposed technique and the limits at which a performance gain over conventional tracking architectures is obtained. The results validate the excellence of the proposed approach for GNSS carrier tracking under scintillation conditions.},

At carrier tracking level, the use of hybrid autoregressive Kalman filter (KF-AR)-based techniques has shown great potential in mitigating its impact onto the performance of GNSS receivers. In this paper we provide a deep analysis for Kalman filter designers to have a clear idea on the interplay of the Kalman modeling parameters onto the steady-state behaviour of these techniques. To this end, we employ the Bayesian Cram{\textasciiacute}er-Rao bound (BCRB) as a useful tool to predict the expected performance of KF-AR techniques in a straightforward manner. Furthermore, we evaluate the goodness of these techniques under stringent working conditions, where the BCRB analysis is further complemented with empirical results, and we show the importance of using adaptive KF-AR implementations to attain optimal performance.},

In the first structure, the Kalman filter innovations are computed by the arctangent phase discriminator, and the state estimates are directly employed in the carrier replica generation. In the second structure, the Kalman filter measurements are the prompt correlator outputs, and the error states are computed and used by a state feedback controller to provide a control signal to drive the carrier replica generation. The nonlinear RBFs provide more flexibility to capture nonlinear dynamics evolving with time, possibly present in the scintillation phase and amplitude. The weights of the RBF networks and the covariance matrices of the process and measurement noise of the Kalman filters are estimated online, in the adaptive Kalman PLL structures. Simulations with synthetic severe scintillation data show the capability of the proposed Kalman PLLs to improve robustness to scintillation effects in carrier synchronization, with performance similar to the corresponding structures employing AR scintillation models. Simulations using recorded scintillation data collected by a commercial receiver highlight the learning and generalization capability of the RBF networks to cope with evolving scintillation characteristics over time with possibly nonlinear effects.

  abstract = {In most wired and wireless systems, carrier tracking is an essential task that allows the receiver to precisely synchronize with the carrier of the incoming signal. Stringent carrier tracking requirements are imposed in systems that are sensitive to carrier mismatches, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), digital communication receivers employing high-order constellations, and terrestrial- or satellitebased positioning systems, just to mention a few. In the recent years, even more critical requirements are being imposed due to the emergence of new applications and services that are pushing traditional systems to operate in much more challenging conditions than the ones for which they were originally designed. The presence of severe fading, signal outages, abrupt phase changes and high user dynamics, are currently compromising the validity of well-known and long-established traditional carrier tracking techniques, thus calling for the development of new robust carrier tracking algorithms. In this paper, we provide a detailed survey on the five main strategies that can be adopted to cope with the technical challenges of robust carrier tracking. These strategies range from some basic optimizations of current tracking loops, to the use of Kalman filter-based architectures, or the application of innovative carrier tracking techniques based on particle filters or compressive sensing. We will also review some open-loop techniques, which are widely adopted in burstmode communications receivers, as an alternative and potential candidate solution for robust carrier tracking in harsh conditions.},

  abstract = {The geomagnetic storm, which is an abnormal space weather phenomenon, can sometimes severely affect GPS signal propagation, thereby impacting the performance of GPS precise point positioning (PPP). However, the investigation of GPS PPP accuracy over the global scale under different geomagnetic storm conditions is very limited. This paper for the first time presents the performance of GPS dual-frequency (DF) and single-frequency (SF) PPP under moderate, intense, and super storms conditions during solar cycle 24 using a large data set collected from about 500 international GNSS services (IGS) stations. The global root mean square (RMS) maps of GPS PPP results show that stations with degraded performance are mainly distributed at high-latitude, and the degradation level generally depends on the storm intensity. The three-dimensional (3D) RMS of GPS DF PPP for high-latitude during moderate, intense, and super storms are 0.393 m, 0.680 m and 1.051 m, respectively, with respect to only 0.163 m on quiet day. RMS errors of mid- and low-latitudes show less dependence on the storm intensities, with values less than 0.320 m, compared to 0.153 m on quiet day. Compared with DF PPP, the performance of GPS SF PPP is inferior regardless of quiet or disturbed conditions. The degraded performance of GPS positioning during geomagnetic storms is attributed to the increased ionospheric disturbances, which have been confirmed by our global rate of TEC index (ROTI) maps. Ionospheric disturbances not only lead to the deteriorated ionospheric correction but also to the frequent cycle-slip occurrence. Statistical results show that, compared with that on quiet day, the increased cycle-slip occurrence are 13.04\%, 56.52\%, and 69.57\% under moderate, intense, and super storms conditions, respectively.},

A brief description of the filter equations its aesthetics, beauty, truth, fascinating perspectives and competence are described. For a Kalman filter design to provide optimal estimates tuning of its statistics namely initial state and covariance, unknown parameters, and state and measurement noise covariances is important. The earlier tuning approaches are reviewed. The present approach is a reference recursive recipe based on multiple filter passes through the data without any optimization to reach a `statistical equilibrium' solution. It utilizes the a priori, a posteriori, and smoothed states, their corresponding predicted measurements and the actual measurements help to balance the measurement equation and similarly the state equation to help form a generalized likelihood cost function. The filter covariance at the end of each pass is heuristically scaled up by the number of data points is further trimmed to statistically match the exact estimates and Cramer Rao Bounds (CRBs) available with no process noise provided the initial covariance for subsequent passes. During simulation studies with process noise the matching of the input and estimated noise sequence over time and in real data the generalized cost functions helped to obtain confidence in the results. Simulation studies of a constant signal, a ramp, a spring, mass, damper system with a weak non linear spring constant, longitudinal and lateral motion of an airplane was followed by similar but more involved real airplane data was carried out in MATLAB. In all cases the present approach was shown to provide internally consistent and best possible estimates and their CRBs.},

  abstract = {LEO satellite-based navigation has gained attention in recent years. However, there has been very little study on the ionospheric effects for signals transmitted from LEO satellites. In this paper, we present simulation studies of the impact of ionospheric plasma irregularities on L-band signals propagating from a LEO satellite to a receiver on the surface of the Earth. We utilize a physics-based and data-consistent GNSS scintillation signal simulator developed by the authors to generate a phase screen model. The parameters of the phase screen model are extracted from ground-based GNSS receiver measurements of scintillation signals transmitted from real GNSS satellites in MEO orbit. Once the phase screen model is established, we simulate LEO satellite orbits from which GNSS-like signals are transmitted and propagated through the phase screen to reach receivers on the Earth surface. Several different configurations of phase screen and LEO satellite orbits and different scintillation severity levels defined by the MEO satellite signal will be simulated. For each pair of the phase screen and LEO satellite configuration and for each scintillation intensity level, we compute the LEO satellite signal amplitude, carrier phase, and phase rate time series as well as scintillation index and de-correlation time observed by a ground-based receiver. The result will provide a quantitative assessment on the ionospheric irregularities effects on LEO satellite transmissions and offer insights toward developing mitigation techniques for future receivers.},

  abstract = {Dynamical characteristics of a complex system can often be inferred from analysis of a stochastic time series model fitted to observations of the system. Oscillations in geophysical systems, for example, are sometimes characterized by principal oscillation patterns, eigenmodes of estimated autoregressive (AR) models of first order. This paper describes the estimation of eigenmodes of AR models of arbitrary order. AR processes of any order can be decomposed into eigenmodes with characteristic oscillation periods, damping times, and excitations. Estimated eigenmodes and confidence intervals for the eigenmodes and their oscillation periods and damping times can be computed from estimated models parameters. As a computationally efficient method of estimating the parameters of AR models  from high-dimensional data, a stepwise least squares algorithm is proposed. This algorithm computes models of successively decreasing order. Numerical simulations indicate that, with the least squares algorithm, the AR model coefficients and the eigenmodes derived from the coefficients and eigenmodes are rough approximations of the confidence intervals inferred from the simulaitons.}

  abstract = {Ionosphere scintillation in GNSS signal can be characterized by scintillation indices computed from the power and phase measurements obtained from the receiver tracking loop outputs. The effectiveness of the scintillation indices is a function of the detrending method used to separate the slowly varying receiver clock, satellite dynamics and low-frequency multipath from the higher frequency scintillations present in the measurements. The prevalent detrending method is a 6 order Butterworth filter with a 0.1 Hz cut-off frequency. The effectiveness of this method has been questioned by a number of researchers. In this paper, a discrete wavelet transform based method is developed as an alternative means for detrending. By applying the two methods on simulated GPS signals, we found that the Butterworth filtering tends to overestimate the scintillation indices while the wavelet filtering tends to underestimate them. Additionally, the wavelet method generates results that are closer to the actual indices' values. Both methods are applied to real GPS scintillation data collected in Alaska. Furthermore, the wavelet filtering leads to a larger correlation between amplitude and phase scintillation.},

  abstract = {The carrier phase received at the receivers of the Global Positioning System (GPS) links is used to detect navigation data and to precisely determine the position, speed and time corresponding to the user's equipment. Therefore, subsystems for carrier phase tracking are crucial parts in all GPS receivers. When the propagation conditions are favorable, the method frequently used for phase tracking is based on Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL)) and implemented through the discrete Costas loop operating under the modulated L1 carrier, in the case of a GPS receiver. This technique is quite simple, well known and very suitable for implementation in low-cost receivers. In this article, we revisit the traditional Costas loop design and point out some issues that affect the phase tracking performance of this loop. In order to overcome these problems, we propose some modifications to the traditional Costas loop. The resulting architecture presents better performance and complexity equivalent to the original loop. Another contribution of this work is the mathematical analysis to evaluate the performance of the new architecture when operating on an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Various results from computational simulations carried out with the two architectures, in different operating scenarios, including AWGN, dynamic stress and ionospheric scintillation are presented and discussed. We conclude that the new architecture outperforms the traditional Costas loop in terms of the variance of the estimated phase error, root mean squared error of the estimated phase and robustness to cycle-slip and loss of lock.},

It is important to understand scintillation phenomena and the approach of different theories. Therefore, we have briefly discussed the theories that are used to interpret ionospheric scintillation data. The global morphology of ionospheric scintillation is also discussed briefly.

  abstract = {Characterization of ionospheric structure starts with spectral analysis of one-dimensional time series. Unknown spectral density function (SDF) parameters are estimated by model-fitting procedures, which will be referred to in this paper collectively as irregularity parameter estimation. If the diagnostic SDF has a power law form, linear least squares estimation (LLE) can be used to estimate the power law parameters. In this paper simulations are used to investigate LLE estimates of diagnostic single-component and two-component power law SDFs. There is a known turbulent strength bias and a more troublesome correlation between the turbulent strength and the spectral index. We found that this intrinsic property of LLE estimators completely explains a similar correlation long observed in both in situ and radio propagation ionospheric diagnostic measurements. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is superior to LLE but requires knowledge of the probability distribution function of the SDF estimator. To this end one can exploit the fact that the probability distribution function of a periodogram about the its true mean is well approximated by a {$X$}D distribution. With an hypothesized true mean SDF defined by a small set of parameters, the parameters can be adjusted to maximize the likelihood that the periodogram was generated by the parameterized SDF. Furthermore, algorithms that adjust parameters to maximize likelihood can use functions of the defining parameters being adjusted to improve performance.},

  abstract = {Stochastic ionospheric structure is characterized by spectral density functions (SDFs), which are formally the average intensity of Fourier transformations of the electron density structure. Structure elongation along magnetic field lines is typically accommodated by constraining contours of constant spatial correlation to field-aligned ellipsoidal surfaces. Structure realizations are generated by imposing the square root of the SDF onto uncorrelated random Fourier modes. The approach has been used successfully for interpreting both in situ and remote propagation diagnostics. However, the only connection to the field-aligned structures generated by the underlying instability mechanism is the correlation scale. This paper introduces a configuration space model that constructs realizations as summations of field-aligned elemental striations with a prescribed scale and peak electron density. We show that by choosing the contributing scales according to a bifurcation rule and imposing a power law intensity scaling, the corresponding SDF closely approximates an inverse power law. Thus, configuration space realizations can be structured to reproduce prescribed or measured SDFs from one-dimensional scans. Stochastic variation comes from an imposed random distribution of striation locations, which are defined by their intercept in a reference slice plane. To conform more directly to physics-based simulations, the striations can be interpreted as voids in the background electron density. The model is designed to support propagation simulations with arbitrary propagation angles relative to the local magnetic field direction. Relations between in situ structure and diagnostic measurements as well as phase screen equivalence can be explored.},

  abstract = {Precise measurements of signal phase are essential for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) position estimates. However, propagation through the earth's ionosphere imposes frequency-dependent phase errors. The frequency dependence is exploited to correct phase errors proportional to total electron content (TEC) divided by frequency. Scintillation causes additional stochastic errors, which can become the largest phase error contribution. Both geometry-free (GFCs) and ionosphere-free (IFCs) frequency combinations are subject to such uncorrectable but generally small phase scintillation errors. A recent published study compared GPS TEC estimates derived from nominally identical L1-L2 and L1-L5 GFCs. The TEC errors establish an upper bound on uncorrelated single-frequency scintillation error contributions. The measured TEC errors were verified with phase-screen simulations. However, a known but largely overlooked phase unwrapping error affects the extraction of signal phase from phase-screen complex signal realizations. This paper demonstrates a procedure for detecting and correcting phase-unwrapping errors and discusses their ramifications.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric structure is characterized by the space--time variation of electron density. However, our understanding of the physical processes that initiate and sustain intermediate-scale structure development does not relate directly to statistical measures that characterize the structure. Consequently, high-resolution physics-based equatorial plasma bubble simulations are essential for identifying systematic relations between statistical structure measures and the underlying physics that initiates and sustains the structure evolution. An earlier paper summarized the analysis of simulated equatorial plasma bubble (EPB) structure initiated with a quasi-periodic bottom-side perturbation that generated five plasma bubbles. The results are representative of real environments. However, the association of the structure development with individual EPBs was difficult to ascertain. This paper summarizes the analysis of new results from single isolated EPB realizations with varying parameters that affect the structure development. The evolution of the single isolated EPB realizations reveal what we have identified as a canonical structure evolution pattern manifest in the space--time development of four quantitative spectral parameters. The onset of structure occurs when the plasma bubble penetrates the F-region peak. The parameter evolution from the initiation point have a fish-like appearance. The three-dimensional structure model can be used to interpret in situ and remote diagnostic measurements as well as predicting the deleterious effects of propagation disturbances on satellite communication, navigation, and surveillance systems.},

  abstract = {The theory propagation in the Earth's ionosphere is well established. However, with the advent of Global Navigation Satellite System measurements, new demands are being placed on satellite system performance evaluation and diagnostic measurements. Propagation simulations are essential for system performance evaluation and they provide guidelines for interpreting diagnostic measurements. This paper presents simulations of propagation in extended highly anisotropic media obtained with split-step integration of the parabolic wave equation. This requires three-dimensional realizations of the electron density structure. A new configuration-space model is used to generate realizations as summations of striations, which are local to field lines with defined scales and peak densities. The scale and peak densities can be selected to generate specified power law spectral density functions. An analytic three-dimensional expectation spectral density function provides a parameterized ionospheric structure model. The simulations results show that replacing the extended structure with an equivalent phase screen placed at the center of the structured region provides statistically equivalent realizations of observation-plane measurements at propagation distances greater than the layer extent. The equivalence is independent of the propagation direction relative to the magnetic field direction, although there is some variation for the extreme propagation disturbances caused by field-aligned propagation. We also investigate the interpretation of in situ and path-integrated diagnostic measurements and two-dimensional propagation models, which are being used to model diagnostic measurements directly.},

Since the success of the fast Fourier transform algorithm, the analysis of serial auto- and cross-correlation in the frequency domain has helped us to understand the dynamics in many serially correlated data without necessarily needing to develop complex parametric models. In this work, we give a nonexhaustive review of the mostly recent nonparametric methods of spectral analysis of multivariate time series, with an emphasis on model-based approaches. We try to give insights into a variety of complimentary approaches for standard and less standard situations (such as nonstationary, replicated, or high-dimensional time series), discuss estimation aspects (such as smoothing over frequency), and include some examples stemming from life science applications (such as brain data).},

ARfit estimates the parameters of AR models from given time series data with a stepwise least squares algorithm that is computationally efficient, in particular when the data are high-dimensional. ARfit modules construct approximate confidence intervals for the estimated parameters and compute statistics with which the adequacy of a fitted model can be assessed. Dynamical characteristics of the modeled time series can be examined by means of a decomposition of a fitted AR model into eigenmodes and associated oscillation periods, damping  times, and excitations. The ARfit module that performs the eigendecomposition of a fitted model also constructs approximate confidence intervals for the eigenmodes and their oscillation periods and damping times.}

  abstract = {The Kalman filter is the minimum-variance state estimator for linear dynamic systems with Gaussian noise. Even if the noise is non-Gaussian, the Kalman filter is the best linear estimator. For nonlinear systems it is not possible, in general, to derive the optimal state estimator in closed form, but various modifications of the Kalman filter can be used to estimate the state. These modifications include the extended Kalman filter, the unscented Kalman filter, and the particle filter. Although the Kalman filter and its modifications are powerful tools for state estimation, we might have information about a system that the Kalman filter does not incorporate. For example, we may know that the states satisfy equality or inequality constraints. In this case we can modify the Kalman filter to exploit this additional information and get better filtering performance than the Kalman filter provides. This paper provides an overview of various ways to incorporate state constraints in the Kalman filter and its nonlinear modifications. If both the system and state constraints are linear, then all of these different approaches result in the same state estimate, which is the optimal constrained linear state estimate. If either the system or constraints are nonlinear, then constrained filtering is, in general, not optimal, and different approaches give different results.},

Studying the ground-based measurements of trans-ionospheric radio signals can contribute to understanding plasma instability mechanisms leading to the development of ionospheric structures. In this regard, radio signals emitted from satellites, making up the Global Positioning System (GPS), and recorded by the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) GPS receivers, are analyzed to study the physical signatures of both amplitude and phase fluctuations. The current ionospheric scintillation paradigm posits that amplitude fluctuations arise from diffraction caused by Fresnel scale ionospheric structures, while refraction is responsible for signal phase variations. The amplitude power spectrum profile consistently displays a rollover frequency, which is not equal to the Fresnel frequency under the Taylor hypothesis. Phase screen theory is used to investigate this phenomenon further and identify an empirical relation between the rollover and Fresnel frequencies. Notably, we have found that the rollover frequency is consistently smaller than the Fresnel frequency. Furthermore, the Fresnel frequency extracted from two-component phase spectra tends to be larger than the rollover frequency. Based on our results, we have concluded that the identified Fresnel frequencies are directly linked to the ionospheric irregularities causing scintillation.},

  abstract = {Strong ionospheric electron content gradients may lead to fast and unpredictable fluctuations in the phase and amplitude of the signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). This phenomenon, known as scintillation, can impair the tracking performance of a GNSS receiver, leading to increased phase and Doppler errors, cycle slips and sometimes to complete losses of signal lock. In order to mitigate scintillation effects at receiver level, the robustness of the carrier tracking loop, the receiver's weakest link under scintillation, must be enhanced. Thanks to their adaptive nature, Kalman Filter (KF) based tracking algorithms are particularly suitable to cope with the variable working conditions imposed by scintillation. However, the effectiveness of this tracking approach strongly depends on the accuracy of the assumed dynamic model, which can quickly become inaccurate under randomly variable scenarios. This research work shows how inaccurate dynamic models can lead to a KF suboptimum solution or divergence when both strong phase and amplitude scintillation are present. Then, to overcome this issue, two novel self-tuning KF based carrier tracking algorithms are proposed. They self-tune their dynamic models by exploiting the knowledge about scintillation, which is achieved by estimating a number of scintillation indices. These types of tracking schemes are particularly suitable for ionospheric scintillation monitor receivers, which are designed for the computation of scintillation indices and other related parameters. Moreover, this thesis analyses and implements algorithms for a reliable computation of scintillation indices even when low cost receivers are exploited. Furthermore, a technique is proposed to compute scintillation indices even if temporary losses of signal lock or cycle slips occur. All algorithms have been assessed by exploiting both simulated and real data affected by high latitude and equatorial scintillation. Results show that the proposed algorithms are able to maintain the signal lock and provide reliable scintillation indices when classical architectures and commercial Ionospheric Scintillation Monitoring Receivers (ISMRs) fail.},

The new feature of this receiver is that it can also measure the amplitude and phase scintillation indices on the SBAS signal received from a geostationary satellite. This observation, with its fixed link geometry, is particularly interesting for the analysis of temporal variation in the scintillation behavior of the equatorial ionosphere. At the same time it allows a direct assessment of the threat posed by scintillation to the SBAS signal. This paper presents the experimental setup, the principle behind the measurements and the first results.},

  abstract = {At equatorial latitudes, ionospheric scintillation is the major limitation in achieving high-accuracy GNSS positioning. This is because scintillation affects the tracking ability of GNSS receivers causing losses of lock and degradation on code pseudorange and carrier phase measurements, thus degrading accuracy. During strong ionospheric scintillation, such effects are more severe and GNSS users cannot rely on the integrity, reliability, and availability required for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach able to greatly reduce these effects of scintillation on precise point positioning (PPP). Our new approach consists of three steps: 1) a new functional model that corrects the effects of range errors in the observables; 2) a new stochastic model that uses these corrections to generate more accurate positioning; and 3) a new strategy to attenuate the effects of losses of lock and consequent ambiguities re-initializations that are caused by the need to re-initialize the tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an experiment using a 30-day static dataset affected by different levels of scintillation in the Brazilian southeastern region. Even with limitations imposed by data gaps, our results demonstrate improvements of up to 80\% in the positioning accuracy. We show that, in the best cases, our method can completely negate the effects of ionospheric scintillation and can recover the original PPP accuracy that would have existed without any scintillation. The significance of this paper lies in the improvement it offers in the integrity, reliability, and availability of GNSS services and applications.},

  abstract = {Transionospheric radio signals might undergo random modulations of their amplitude and phase caused by scattering on irregular structures in the ionosphere. These scintillation phenomena are highly anisotropic, depend on local geomagnetic field configuaration and on the relative position of the signal receiver and scattering irregularity. We derive analytical expressions of anisotropic amplitude and phase scintillation indices using the model of a thin random phase screen. These results extend the classical derivations of [C. Rino, Radio Sci. 14, 1135 (1979)] to a larger domain of applicability including very slant propagation links of the radio wave signals. The derived generalization is based on the assumption that the ionospheric scattering layer has a spherical symmetry as opposed to the original Rino's assumption of a plan-parallel ionospheric layer. The derived scintillation indices have the simpler analytical form, determine the regions of enhanced scintillation by taking into account the finite curvature of the Earth and of the ionospheric shell, and are divergence-free for large zenith angles of propagation links. For the illustration we discuss the geometric enhancement of scintillation for communication links via a geostationary beacon satellite over the equator.},

This effect is known as scintillation. This article reviews basic theoretical concepts and simulation strategies for modeling the scintillation phenomenon. We focused our attention primarily on the methods connected with the random phase screen model. For a weak scattering regime on random ionospheric irregularities, a single-phase screen model enables us to obtain the analytic expression for phase and intensity scintillation indices, as well as the statistical quantities characterizing the strength of scintillation-related fades and distortions. In the case of multiple scattering, the simulation with multiple phase screens becomes a handy tool for obtaining these indices. For both scattering regimes, the statistical properties of the ionospheric random medium play an important role in scintillation modeling and are discussed with an emphasis on related geometric aspects. As an illustration, the phase screen simulation approaches used in the global climatological scintillation model GISM are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Multiple studies of scintillation phenomena have shown that, in certain situations, the intense phase fluctuations of trans-ionospheric radio signals are associated with the scattering on strong electron density gradients. The present study provides a theoretical framework for modeling such types of phase fluctuation events. Using the geometrical-optics approximation and retaining the second-order smallness correction in the expansion of the eikonal function, we relate the phase of the transmitted wave not only to the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere but also to the spatial gradient of the TEC. The considered correction term is related to the random refraction of signal rays on large-scale ionospheric structures, an effect, that becomes significant in the presence of strong electron density gradients. To conveniently simulate the wave propagation under such conditions, we propose the random phase gradient screen algorithm. For this purpose, we use the novel spatial electron density gradient product (NeGIX) based on in-situ observations of the Swarm Langmuir probe and ground-based TEC and TEC gradient observations. To illustrate the performance of the algorithm, we apply it to simulate a scintillation event over Europe and in the low-latitude region and compare the simulation results with scintillation indices, measured from GNSS ground observations. We show that in regions of the ionosphere where spatial ionospheric gradients are large, the phase gradient method shows better agreement with the observed scintillation levels than the conventional phase screen approach.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric scintillation is the name given to the disturbance caused by electron density irregularities along the propagation path of electromagnetic waves through the iono sphere. These non-nominal propagation conditions mainly cause carrier phase variations and amplitude fades. It is im portant to point out that both degradations are correlated, and thus deep amplitude fades and rapid phase variations (the so called canonical fades) occur in a simultaneous and random manner. Regarding the carrier synchronization problem under harsh propagation conditions, such as high dynamics, multipath effects or ionospheric scintillation, canonical fades make the latter the most challenging scenario, which can be considered as a benchmark on the performance of robust carrier track ing techniques. This phenomenon particularly affects satellite based positioning systems in the equatorial regions and at high latitudes. In this work, both amplitude and phase variations due to scintillation are first modeled using an autoregressive (AR) model, and then included into the system state-space formulation. Therefore, a Kalman filter (KF) based solution can be aware of both dynamics and scintillation phase evolutions. This arises as the natural solution to mitigate those undesired propagation effects. Moreover, in order to counteract the main drawbacks of standard KF-based tracking solutions, an extended KF (EKF) architecture is considered, tracking both the phase dynamics, scintillation phase and amplitude. This implies directly operating with the baseband received signal's complex samples, avoiding the use discriminators and thus its saturation and the loss of Gaussianity. Simulation results are provided to support the theoretical discussion and to show the performance improvements of such new approach.},

  abstract = {Carrier synchronization is a fundamental stage in the receiver side of any communication or positioning system. Traditional carrier phase tracking techniques are based on well-known phase-locked loop (PLL) closed-loop architectures, which are still the methods of choice in modern receivers. Those techniques are well understood, easy to tune, and perform well under benign propagation conditions, but their applicability is seriously compromised in harsh propagation environments, where the signal may be affected by high dynamics, shadowing, strong fadings, multipath effects, or ionospheric scintillation. From an optimal filtering standpoint, the Kalman filter (KF) is clearly a powerful alternative, but the synchronization community seems still reluctant to exploit all the potential it has to offer. The purpose of this article is twofold: i) to review the basics and state of the art on both PLL and KF-based tracking techniques and ii) to present and justify the reasoning behind the systematic use of KF-based tracking approaches instead of the well-established PLL-based architectures from both theoretical and practical points of view. To support the discussion, two specific scenarios of interest to the aerospace community are numerically evaluated: robust carrier tracking of global navigation satellite systems' signals and synchronization in a deep space communications system.},

  abstract = {Carrier synchronization is of paramount importance in any communications or positioning system. Mass-market Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers typically implement traditional carrier tracking techniques based on well-established phase-locked loop architectures, which are only reliable in quite benign propagation conditions. Under nonnominal harsh propagation conditions, the signal may be affected by shadowing, strong fading, multipath or severe ionospheric scintillation, and thus, traditional architectures are not valid anymore and there exists an actual need for robust tracking solutions. Several approaches to overcome the conventional PLL limitations have appeared during the last decade, being the Kalman filter (KF) based architectures the most promising research line. The main drawback of standard KFs is the assumption of perfectly known process and measurement noise statistics, a knowledge that is always constrained by the system model accuracy. Beyond heuristic solutions, a general framework for the design of adaptive KFs correctly dealing with both process and measurement noises, that would be of capital importance for the practitioner, has not been established. The main goal of this contribution is to provide a clear answer to this fundamental question. It is shown that the main driver on the KF performance is not the adjustment of the measurement noise but the adequate tuning of the process noise statistics. Within this framework, a comprehensive discussion is given for the correct design of adaptive KF architectures for robust carrier tracking applications, where the key idea is to use two independent noise statistics estimation strategies to sequentially adapt both parameters. The design choice is supported by a discussion on the identifiability of the noise statistics' parameters. Simulation results are provided showing the need of fully adaptive solutions, and the achieved performance gain of KF-based architectures when compared to traditional tracking loops.},

The signal distortion induced by scintillation can pose a major threat to some GNSS application. Scintillation is one of the more challenging propagation scenarios, particularly affecting high-precision GNSS receivers which require high quality carrier phase measurements; and safety critical applications which have strict accuracy, availability and integrity requirements. Under ionospheric scintillation conditions, GNSS signals are affected by fast amplitude and phase variations, which can compromise the receiver synchronization. To take into account the underlying correlation among different frequency bands, we propose a new multivariate autoregressive model (MAR) for the multi-frequency ionospheric scintillation process. Multi-frequency GNSS observations and the scintillation MAR are modeled in state-space, allowing independent tracking of both line-of-sight phase variations and complex gain scintillation components. The resulting joint synchronization and scintillation mitigation problem is solved using a robust nonlinear Kalman filter, validated using real multi-frequency scintillation data with encouraging results.},

One of the main disadvantages of standard phase tracking architectures is the estimation vs mitigation tradeoff, that is, it is impossible to distinguish between the line-ofsight (LOS) phase contribution of interest and phase variations induced by the ionosphere. A possible solution is to consider a state-space formulation of the problem, where the scintillation amplitude and phase are estimated together with the LOS phase variations. The current Kalman filter-based techniques exploiting this idea consider an off-line scintillation model fitting, thus not suitable for real-life applications. In this contribution we propose an adaptive model learning strategy to be able to cope with timevarying unknown scintillation conditions.

Under scintillation, GNSS signals are affected by amplitude and phase variations, which mainly compromise the synchronization stage of the receiver. To counteract these effects, one must resort to advanced signal-processing techniques such as adaptive/robust methods, machine learning, or parameter estimation. This contribution reviews the signal-processing landscape in GNSS receivers, with emphasis on different detection, monitoring, and mitigation problems. New results using real data are provided to support the discussion. To conclude, future perspectives of interest to the GNSS community are discussed.},

Drift velocities measured by the colocated Poker Flat incoherent scatter radar are cross compared against the estimated results from the GNSS receiver array. A comparative study is conducted based on two case studies on 20 and 31 December 2015, both accompanied by intense geomagnetic storms.

These cycle slips can lead to meter-level errors in the altimetry retrieval.

The retrieved sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) has an average root mean square (rms) of 7.3 cm for sea and sea ice surface reflections relative to the mean sea surface (MSS).

  abstract = {The fading characteristics of ionospheric amplitude scintillations can be described by a cumulative amplitude probability distribution function (cdf). The cdf expresses the probability (percentage of time) that the signal amplitude will equal or exceed a given amplitude. Distributions of amplitude variations are made with the use of ionospheric scintillations observed on beacon signals from synchronous satellites transmitting at 136 MHz. The resulting distributions are divided into six groups corresponding to ranges of the scintillation index, the predominant measure in scintillation studies. The model distributions are then combined with the occurrence of scintillations in various index ranges to produce cumulative amplitude probability distributions. These have been done for long-term observations made at Hamilton, Massachusetts, Narssarssuaq, Greenland, and Huancayo, Peru. The results allow engineers to determine margins necessary for communication and navigation systems. Individual 15-min distributions have been compared to the theoretical distributions obtained by Nakagami [1960] in his m-distribution method of characterizing amplitude scintillation and were found to be in good agreement. The m parameter is shown to be a measure of the frequency dependence of scintillations and can be used to determine a spectral index for interpolating the amplitude distributions to other frequencies of interest.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of a nuclear-disturbed environment on the transmission of electromagnetic (EM) waves through the atmosphere. An atmospheric nuclear detonation can produce heightened free electron densities in the surrounding atmosphere that can disrupt EM waves that propagate through the disturbed region. Radiation transport models simulated the ionization and free electron densities created in the atmosphere from a 1 MT detonation at heights of burst of 5 km, 25 km, and 75 km. Recombination rates for the free electrons in the atmosphere were applied, from previous work in the literature, to determine the nuclear-induced electron densities as a function of time and space after the detonation. A ray-tracing algorithm was applied to determine the refraction and reflection of waves propagating in the different nuclear-disturbed environments. The simulation results show that the free electron plasma created from an atmospheric nuclear detonation depend on the height of burst of the weapon, the weapon yield, and the time after detonation. Detonations at higher altitudes produce higher free electron densities for greater durations and over larger ranges. The larger the free electron densities, the greater the impact on EM wavelengths in regards to refraction, reflection, and absorption in the atmosphere. An analysis of modern infrastructure and the effects of nuclear-disturbed atmospheres on different signal wavelengths and systems is discussed.},

  author = {Xu, Dongyang and Jiao, Yu and Rino, Charles},
  abstract = {In this paper, two robust adaptive-gain algorithms were developed to track signals received on a dynamic platform under strong equatorial scintillation. One of them is a simple adaptive-gain algorithm based on a phase lock loop (ABPLL) structure, and the other is developed under an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) framework summarized in a previous study. A recently developed physic-based scintillation simulator was employed in this paper to generate realistic scintillation observed on dynamic platforms. Based on three typical trajectories with a speed close to an aircraft, the simulator generated three different scenarios of scintillation with fast, moderate-speed, and slow scintillation parameter variations. The bandwidth limits that the scintillation under these three scenarios place on a conventional PLL are then evaluated under different integration times using the simulated data. Based on the evaluation results, the bandwidth values for the ABPLL under different fading levels are determined. The results also revealed that no combination of fixed bandwidth and integration time can be used to successfully track the scintillation data under all three scenarios. The AKF algorithm developed in this study is innovated under a heuristic attempt to model the scintillation induced phase variation in the same fashion of modeling oscillator noise as a part of the system noise. Both algorithms were then evaluated using simulated data with combined scintillation and platform dynamics of all three scenarios, each containing 10 realizations of 600-second data. The results showed successfully tracking of all 30 realizations under short integration times.},

The traditional method uses a fixed-gain loop filter for error estimation, which is prone to lose lock and causes inaccurate navigation and positioning. This paper proposes a cascaded adaptive vector tracking method based on the KF+EKF architecture through the GNSS Software defined receiver in the signal tracking module and the navigation solution module. The linear relationships between the pseudo-range error and the code phase error, the pseudo-range rate error and the carrier frequency error are obtained as the measurement, and the navigation filter estimation is performed. The signal C/N0 ratio and innovation sequence are used to adjust the measurement noise covariance matrix and the process noise covariance matrix, respectively. Then, the estimated error value is used to correct the navigation parameters and fed back to the local code/carrier NCO. The field vehicle test results show that, in the case of sufficient satellite signals, the positioning error of the proposed method has a slight advantage compared with the traditional method. When there is signal occlusion or interference, the traditional method cannot achieve accurate positioning. However, the proposed method can maintain the same accuracy for the positioning results.},

  abstract = {Ionospheric disturbances can be detrimental to accuracy and reliability of GNSS positioning. We focus on how ionospheric scintillation induces significant degradation to Precise Point Positioning (PPP) and how to improve the performance of PPP during ionospheric scintillation periods. We briefly describe these problems and give the physical explanation of highly correlated phenomenon of degraded PPP estimates and occurrence of ionospheric scintillation. Three possible reasons can contribute to significant accuracy degradation in the presence of ionospheric scintillation: (a) unexpected loss of lock of tracked satellites which greatly reduces the available observations and considerably weakens the geometry, (b) abnormal blunders which are not properly mitigated by positioning programs, and (c) failure of cycle slip detection algorithms due to the high rate of total electronic content. The latter two reasons are confirmed as the major causes of sudden accuracy degradation by means of a comparative analysis. To reduce their adverse effect on positioning, an improved approach based on a robust iterative Kalman filter is adopted to enhance the PPP performance. Before the data enter the filter, the differential code biases are used for GNSS data quality checking. Any satellite whose C1--P1 and P1--P2 biases exceed 10 and 30~m, respectively, will be rejected. Both the Melbourne--Wubbena and geometry-free combination are used for cycle slip detection. But the thresholds are set more flexibly when ionospheric conditions become unusual. With these steps, most of the outliers and cycle slips can be effectively detected, and a first PPP estimation can be carried out. Furthermore, an iterative PPP estimator is utilized to mitigate the remaining gross errors and cycle slips which will be reflected in the posterior residuals. Further validation tests based on extensive experiments confirm our physical explanation and the new approach. The results show that the improved approach effectively avoids a large number of ambiguity resets which would otherwise be necessary. It reduces the number of re-parameterized phase ambiguities by approximately half, without scarifying the accuracy and reliability of the PPP solution.},
